## Problem Statement

| Issue                            | Description                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lengthy Wait Times               | It takes approximately 60 minutes for employees to go to the canteen, wait in queues, collect their food, and find a table. This time can be better utilised for work or relaxation. |
| Limited Food Choices             | Employees often do not get the food they desire due to items running out of stock in the canteens.                  |
| Food Wastage                     | The canteens currently dispose of a significant amount of unsold food, resulting in financial losses and environmental concerns. |
